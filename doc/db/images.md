# Databases for Image data

The image database holds the filepath for images and image data unique
to each user image.


Contains
-------------
| Field | Description|
|-------|------------|
| _id | the unique document id generated by mongodb that acts as a primary key for this document |
| hash | This is a sha1 key that will help prevent duplication on our server |
| size | This is the size in bytes of the image. |
| modified | This is a javascript date object for when the image was last modified. |
| uid | This is the unique id for the user that owns the image. |
| metadata | This is user generated data about images. e.g. Rating, tags |
| location | This is the location of the image on our server. |

```
LokiJs uses a $loki field instead of the _id field and uses integers instead of
ObjectIds
```
